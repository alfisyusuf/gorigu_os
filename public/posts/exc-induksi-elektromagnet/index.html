Number 6 Question: If a conductor 0.2m long moves with a velocity of 0.3m/s in a magnetic field of 5T, calculate the emf induced if the magnetic field, velocity, and length of conductor are mutually perpendicular to each other.\na) 0.3V\nb) 0.03V\nc) 30V\nd) 3V\nReveal Answer Answer: a Explanation: The formula for induced emf is: emf=Blv if B, l, v are perpendicular to each other. Substituting the values of B, l, and v from the question, we get emf=0.3V.  Number 7 Question: Find the length of a conductor which is moving with a velocity 0.4m/s in a magnetic field of 8T, inducing an emf of 20V if magnetic field, velocity, and length of conductor are mutually perpendicular to each other.\na) 50m\nb) 5m\nc) 6.25m\nd) 0.5m\nReveal Answer Answer: c Explanation: The formula for induced emf is: emf=Blv if B, l, v are perpendicular to each other. Substituting the values of B, emf, and v from the question, we get l=6.25m.  Number 8 Question: Find the strength of the magnetic field in a conductor 0.5m long moving with a velocity of 10m/s, inducing an emf of 20V if magnetic field, velocity, and length of conductor are mutually perpendicular to each other.\na) 1T\nb) 2T\nc) 3T\nd) 4T\nReveal Answer Answer: d Explanation: The formula for induced emf is: emf=Blv if B, l, v are perpendicular to each other. Substituting the values of l, emf, and v from the question, we get B=4T.  Number 9 Question: What does emf stand for?\na) Electronic magnetic force\nb) Electromotive force\nc) Electromagnetic force\nd) Electromated force\nReveal Answer Answer: b Explanation: Emf stands for electromotive force. It is the voltage developed by any source of electrical energy.  Number 10 Question: What is emf?\na) Force\nb) Voltage\nc) Current\nd) Flux\nReveal Answer Answer: b Explanation: Electromotive force is not actually a force. It is basically a voltage. It is the voltage developed by any source of electrical energy.  Number 11 Question: Pick out the SI unit of magnetic flux.\na) Ampere\nb) Tesla meter\nc) Weber\nd) Maxwell\nReveal Answer Answer: c Explanation: The SI unit of magnetic flux is weber (Wb). One weber is the flux produced when a uniform magnetic field of one tesla acts normally over an area of 1 cm2.  Number 12 Question: Calculate the magnetic flux when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the surface area.\na) Minimum\nb) Maximum\nc) Zero\nd) Depends on the surface area\nReveal Answer Answer: b Explanation: Magnetic flux = B A cos 0° Magnetic flux = B A. It follows that magnetic flux linked with a surface is maximum when the direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the surface area.  Number 13 Question: Which type of physical quantity is magnetic flux?\na) Scalar\nb) Vector\nc) Isotropic\nd) Isentropic\nReveal Answer Answer: a Explanation: The magnetic flux is measured as the product of the component of the magnetic field normal to the surface and the surface area. Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity.  Number 14 Question: What is the instrument used in Faraday’s experiment?\na) Galvanometer\nb) Ammeter\nc) Voltmeter\nd) Meter Bridge\nReveal Answer Answer: a Explanation: Faraday used a galvanometer and connected it to a coil. A bar magnet was pushed towards the coil, such that the north-pole is pointing towards the coil. As the bar magnet is shifted, the pointer in the galvanometer gets deflected, thus indicating the presence of current in the coil.  Number 15 Question: Which among the following affects the deflection in the galvanometer?\na) Area of the coil\nb) Current passing through the coil\nc) Speed with which the bar magnet is pulled towards or away from the coil\nd) Resistance offered for current flow\nReveal Answer Answer: c Explanation: The deflection of the pointer is larger or smaller depending upon the speed with which the bar magnet is pulled towards or away from the coil. Moreover, the direction of deflection of the pointer depends upon the direction of motion of the bar magnet.  Number 16 Question: Which among the following is true about Faraday’s law of Induction?\na) An emf is induced in a conductor when it cuts the magnetic flux\nb) An emf is induced in a conductor when it moves parallel to the magnetic field\nc) An emf is induced in a conductor when it moves perpendicular to the magnetic field\nd) An emf is induced in a conductor when it is just entering a magnetic field\nReveal Answer Answer: a Explanation: According to Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, an emf is induced in a conductor when it cuts across the flux of a magnetic field. If the two ends of the conductor are connected to an outside circuit, the induced emf causes current to flow in the circuit.  Number 17 Question: What is proportional to the magnitude of the induced emf in the circuit?\na) Rate of change of current in the circuit\nb) Rate of change of resistance offered\nc) Rate of change of magnetic flux\nd) Rate of change of voltage\nReveal Answer Answer: c Explanation: The magnitude of induced emf is equal is equal to the time rate of change of magnetic flux. It is mathematically expressed as: ε = dϕ / dt. The negative sign indicates the direction of the emf induced. This is Faraday’s second law of electromagnetic induction.  Number 18 Question: Faraday’s laws are the result of the conservation of which quantity?\na) Momentum\nb) Energy\nc) Charge\nd) Magnetic field\nReveal Answer Answer: b Explanation: Faraday’s laws are the result of the conservation of energy. These laws are based on the conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy. Mechanical energy can be converted into electrical energy such as in the example of a dynamo. In the same way, electrical energy can be converted into mechanical energy such as in the example of an electric motor. Both of the above examples work on the principle of Faraday’s law.  Bonus 1 Question: The magnetic flux in a closed circuit of resistance 20 Ω varies with time t as Φ = 4t³ + 2t² – 15t + 3. Calculate the magnitude of induced emf at t = 1s.\na) 3 V\nb) 4 V\nc) 5 V\nd) 6 V\nReveal Answer Answer: 1 V Explanation: To calculate the magnitude of the induced electromotive force (emf) at \\(t = 1s\\), we can use Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which relates the emf (\\(ε\\)) to the rate of change of magnetic flux (\\(\\frac{dΦ}{dt}\\)) in a closed circuit:\n$$ ε = -\\frac{dΦ}{dt} $$ Here, Φ is given as a function of time \\(t\\): \\(Φ = 4t^3 + 2t^2 - 15t + 3\\). So, we need to find \\(\\frac{dΦ}{dt}\\) and then calculate the emf (\\(ε\\)) at \\(t = 1s\\).\nLet's start by finding \\(\\frac{dΦ}{dt}\\):\n$$ \\frac{dΦ}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} (4t^3 + 2t^2 - 15t + 3) $$ Now, let's find the derivative with respect to time \\(t\\):\n$$ \\frac{dΦ}{dt} = 12t^2 + 4t - 15 $$ Now, plug in the value \\(t = 1s\\) to calculate \\(\\frac{dΦ}{dt}\\) at \\(t = 1s\\):\n$$ \\frac{dΦ}{dt} = 12(1)^2 + 4(1) - 15 $$ $$ \\frac{dΦ}{dt} = 12 + 4 - 15 = 1 $$ So, \\(\\frac{dΦ}{dt}\\) at \\(t = 1s\\) is 1.\nNow, we can calculate the emf (\\(ε\\)) using Faraday's law:\n$$ ε = -\\frac{dΦ}{dt} = -1\\, \\text{V/s} = -1\\, \\text{V} $$ Since the magnitude of the emf is always positive, we take the absolute value:\nMagnitude of emf = 1 V\nNone of the answer choices matches the result you've calculated. It appears that there may be an issue with the question or answer choices provided.\n Number 20 Question: Which law is used in finding the direction of current in a.c. generator?\na) Maxwell’s law\nb) Lenz’s law\nc) Corkscrew law\nd) Ampere circuital law\nReveal Answer Answer: b Explanation: In an a.c. generator, induced current due to a change of magnetic flux linked with a closed circuit can be found out using Lenz's law. Lenz's law, in electromagnetism, statement that an induced electric current flows in a direction such that the current opposes the change that induced it.\n function toggleAnswer(number) { var x = document.getElementById(\"answer\" + number); if (x.style.display === \"none\" || x.style.display === \"\") { x.style.display = \"block\"; } else { x.style.display = \"none\"; } }  ",

<h2 id="bonus-1">Bonus 1<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bonus-1">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> The magnetic flux in a closed circuit of resistance 20 Ω varies with time t as Φ = 4t³ + 2t² – 15t + 3. Calculate the magnitude of induced emf at t = 1s.</p>
<p>a) 3 V</p>
<p>b) 4 V</p>
<p>c) 5 V</p>
<p>d) 6 V</p>


<button disabled onclick="toggleAnswer(19)">Reveal Answer</button>

<div id="answer19" style="display: none">

<strong>Answer:</strong> 1 V

<br><strong>Explanation:</strong>
<p>To calculate the magnitude of the induced electromotive force (emf) at \(t = 1s\), we can use Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which relates the emf (\(ε\)) to the rate of change of magnetic flux (\(\frac{dΦ}{dt}\)) in a closed circuit:</p>

$$
ε = -\frac{dΦ}{dt}
$$

<p>Here, Φ is given as a function of time \(t\): \(Φ = 4t^3 + 2t^2 - 15t + 3\). So, we need to find \(\frac{dΦ}{dt}\) and then calculate the emf (\(ε\)) at \(t = 1s\).</p>

<p>Let's start by finding \(\frac{dΦ}{dt}\):</p>

$$
\frac{dΦ}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} (4t^3 + 2t^2 - 15t + 3)
$$

<p>Now, let's find the derivative with respect to time \(t\):</p>

$$
\frac{dΦ}{dt} = 12t^2 + 4t - 15
$$

<p>Now, plug in the value \(t = 1s\) to calculate \(\frac{dΦ}{dt}\) at \(t = 1s\):</p>

$$
\frac{dΦ}{dt} = 12(1)^2 + 4(1) - 15
$$

$$
\frac{dΦ}{dt} = 12 + 4 - 15 = 1
$$

<p>So, \(\frac{dΦ}{dt}\) at \(t = 1s\) is 1.</p>

<p>Now, we can calculate the emf (\(ε\)) using Faraday's law:</p>

$$
ε = -\frac{dΦ}{dt} = -1\, \text{V/s} = -1\, \text{V}
$$

<p>Since the magnitude of the emf is always positive, we take the absolute value:</p>

<p>Magnitude of emf = 1 V</p>
