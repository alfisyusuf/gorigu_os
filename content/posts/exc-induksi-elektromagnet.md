## Number 1

**Question:** An E.M.F. can be induced by … .

a) Change in the magnetic field only

b) Change in the area of cross section only

c) Change in angle between magnetic field and area only

d) Change in the magnetic field, area, or angle between them

<div id="answer1" style="display: none">

<strong>Answer:</strong> d

<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> emf=-dϕ/dt. We know ϕ flux is the dot product of the magnetic field vector and area vector.
ϕ=BAcos(θ), hence if either of the three, that is, magnetic field, area, or angle changes, the emf will change, flux changes due to which emf can be induced.

<strong>Answer:</strong> a

<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Faraday used a galvanometer and connected it to a coil. A bar magnet was pushed towards the coil, such that the north-pole is pointing towards the coil.

## Bonus 1

b) 4 V

c) 5 V

d) 6 V

{{< rawhtml >}}

<button onclick="toggleAnswer(19)">Reveal Answer</button>

<div id="answer19" style="display: none">

<strong>Answer:</strong> 1 V

<br><strong>Explanation:</strong>
<p>To calculate the magnitude of the induced electromotive force (emf) at \(t = 1s\), we can use Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which relates the emf (\(ε\)) to the rate of change of magnetic flux (\(\frac{dΦ}{dt}\)) in a closed circuit:</p>

$$
ε = -\frac{dΦ}{dt}
$$

<p>Here, Φ is given as a function of time \(t\): \(Φ = 4t^3 + 2t^2 - 15t + 3\). So, we need to find \(\frac{dΦ}{dt}\) and then calculate the emf (\(ε\)) at \(t = 1s\).</p>

<p>Let's start by finding \(\frac{dΦ}{dt}\):</p>

$$
\frac{dΦ}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} (4t^3 + 2t^2 - 15t + 3)
$$

<p>Now, let's find the derivative with respect to time \(t\):</p>

$$
\frac{dΦ}{dt} = 12t^2 + 4t - 15
$$

<p>Now, plug in the value \(t = 1s\) to calculate \(\frac{dΦ}{dt}\) at \(t = 1s\):</p>

$$
\frac{dΦ}{dt} = 12(1)^2 + 4(1) - 15
$$

$$
\frac{dΦ}{dt} = 12 + 4 - 15 = 1
$$

<p>So, \(\frac{dΦ}{dt}\) at \(t = 1s\) is 1.</p>

<p>Now, we can calculate the emf (\(ε\)) using Faraday's law:</p>

$$
ε = -\frac{dΦ}{dt} = -1\, \text{V/s} = -1\, \text{V}
$$

<p>Since the magnitude of the emf is always positive, we take the absolute value:</p>

<p>Magnitude of emf = 1 V</p>

{{< rawhtml >}}

<button onclick="toggleAnswer(21)">Reveal Answer</button>

<div id="answer21" style="display: none">

<strong>Answer:</strong> a

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Motional electromotive is the emf induced by the motion of the conductor across the magnetic field. The expression for motional electromotive force is given by:<br>
E = -vLB<br>

## Number 22

a) 0.7 V

b) 7 V

c) 14 V

d) 1.4 V

{{< rawhtml >}}

<button onclick="toggleAnswer(22)">Reveal Answer</button>

<div id="answer22" style="display: none">

<strong>Answer:</strong> c

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Explanation: Length (L) = 0.7 m; Speed (v) = 1 m/s; Magnetic field (B) = 20 T<br>
The required equation E = -vLB (The negative sign only applies to the direction)<br>
E = 1 × 0.7 × 20<br>
E = 0.7 × 20<br>
E = 14 V<br>
Therefore, the motional emf in the bar and rails is 14 V.</p>

## Number 23

A bar of length 0.15 m slides along metal rails at a speed of 5 m/s. The bar and rails are in a magnetic field of 40 T, pointing out into the page. The resistance of two resistors in parallel is both 20 Ω, and the resistance of the bar is 5 Ω. What is the current in the bar?

a) 1 A

b) 2 A

c) 3 A

d) 5 A

{{< rawhtml >}}

<button onclick="toggleAnswer(23)">Reveal Answer</button>

<div id="answer23" style="display: none">

<strong>Answer:</strong> b

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> \(L = 0.15 m; B = 40 T; v = 5 m/s; R_1 = 10 Ω; R_2 = 10 Ω; R_3 = 5 Ω\)<br>
Emf (E) = vLB = 5 × 0.15 × 40<br>
E = 5 × 6<br>
E = 30 V<br>
R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are in parallel ➔ \(\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} = \frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{20} = \frac{2}{20} = \frac{1}{10}
\) ➔ R = 10 Ω<br>
R<sub>TOT</sub> = R + R<sub>3</sub> = 10 + 5 = 15 Ω<br>
Therefore, current (I) = \(\frac{E}{R}\)<br>
I = \(\frac{30}{15}\)<br>
I = 2 A</p>

## Number 24

A bar of length 2m is said to fall freely in a magnetic field of magnitude 50 T. What is the motional emf in the bar when it has fallen 40 meters?

a) 700 V

b) 2100 V

c) 2800 V

d) 1400 V

{{< rawhtml >}}

<button onclick="toggleAnswer(24)">Reveal Answer</button>

<div id="answer24" style="display: none">

<strong>Answer:</strong> c

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

<p>Given:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(L = 2 \, m\)</li>
  <li>\(B = 50 \, T\)</li>
</ul>

<p>The bar is falling freely, so \(u = 0\). According to Newton’s third equation \(v^2 - u^2 = 2gh\), where \(h = 40 \, m\).</p>

$$
v^2 = 2gh
$$

$$
v^2 = 2 \times 9.8 \times 40
$$

$$
v^2 = 784
$$

$$
v = \sqrt{784} = 28 \, m/s
$$

<p>Now, calculate the motional emf (\(E\)):</p>

$$
E = vLB
$$

$$
E = 28 \times 2 \times 50
$$

$$
E = 2800 \, V
$$

<p>Therefore, the motional emf in the bar when it has fallen 40 meters is \(2800 \, V\), which corresponds to option (c) in the given choices.</p>

What is the rate at which energy is being transferred to thermal energy?

a) 0.225 W

b) 22.55 W

c) 2.25 × \\(10^{-4}\\) W

d) 2.25 × \\(10^{-3}\\) W

{{< rawhtml >}}

<button onclick="toggleAnswer(25)">Reveal Answer</button>

<div id="answer25" style="display: none">

<strong>Answer:</strong> d

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

<p>Given:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(B = 0.5 \, T\)</li>
  <li>\(v = 70 \, cm/s = 70 \times 10^{-2} \, m/s\)</li>
  <li>\(L = 45 \, cm = 45 \times 10^{-2} \, m\)</li>
  <li>\(R = 10 \, Ω\)</li>
</ul>

<p>Motional emf (\(E\)) can be calculated using \(E = vLB\):</p>

$$
E = 70 \times 10^{-2} \times 45 \times 10^{-2} \times 0.5 = 0.15 \, V
$$

<p>Now, calculate the current (\(I\)) using \(I = \frac{E}{R}\):</p>

$$
I = \frac{0.15}{10} = 0.015 \, A
$$

<p>The rate at which energy is being transferred to thermal energy (\(P\)) can be calculated using \(P = I^2R\):</p>

$$
P = (0.015)^2 \times 10 = 2.25 \times 10^{-3} \, W
$$

<p>Therefore, the rate at which energy is being transferred to thermal energy is \(2.25 \times 10^{-3} \, W\), which corresponds to option (d) in the given choices.</p>
